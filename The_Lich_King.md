## Description



- The Lich King is the final boss of Icecrown Citadel and the final major encounter of World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.

- This boss has been available since February 2, 2010 on US servers and February 3 on EU servers.

- The Lich King is a long and challenging battle for survival. All classes are tested to the limits of their abilities, in particular all raid members have to react quickly to various abilities, often several at the same time. The encounter is rather unforgiving; most players must react properly in various situations, and all players get ample opportunity to commit mistakes which then wipe the raid. This encounter is a fitting end to Wrath of the Lich King and on par with Yogg-Saron in Ulduar.
