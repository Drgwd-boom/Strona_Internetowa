- Sindragosa is the second boss of the Frostwing Halls wing of the Icecrown Citadel raid. The encounter with the undead frost wyrm queen is similar to Sapphiron. She spawns after the defeat of the frost wyrms Rimefang (who escaped the Pit of Saron after Tyrannus' death) and Spinestalker. It is a battle for survival, where players have to manage various debuff stacks.
