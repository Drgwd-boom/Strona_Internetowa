# My favourite Icecrown Citadel Bosses

## [The Lich King](The_Lich_King.md)
The Lich King was the final test. Beat him with a bunch of randoms, and the cutscene in the middle was so epic it almost made me forget I was about to get obliterated. Almost.

## [Lord Marrowgar](Lord_Marrowgar.md)
Lord Marrowgar and his spikes are a blast! He was the first boss I downed in ICC, and I’ll never forget the joy of hearing those spikes go *crunch*. Also, he's the first boss I’ve ever had the pleasure of ‘adopting’ (he might not agree though).

## [Professor Putricide](Professor_Putricide.md)
Putricide's mechanics always left me scratching my head. I’m convinced my raid team survived mostly because of pure luck and the slime gods smiling upon us. Half the time, I didn’t even know what was going on. Spoiler: we still managed to win.

## [Sindragosa](Sindragosa.md)
Ah, Sindragosa. We wiped on her more times than I’d like to admit, and probably more than on the final boss of the game. Honestly, I think I had a better chance of beating her if I spent more time dodging her *frost breaths* and less time making memes about how much we wiped.
